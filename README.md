Use the Lahman2016 SQL file and execute it in MySQL to create the lahman2016 MLB database. This database is required to get player statistics for the APP.

App Description:
Phase - I of the APP:
  In this phase the app takes player First Name and Last Name as input and gives user 3 options to know about the player.
    Option - 1: Player Info
      In this option User gets to the know player details such as (Date Of Birth, Birth Country, Height, Weight, Debut Date and Throw         arm)
     
    Option - 2: Player Statistics
        In this option user get to choose the category of the player stats they want to see (Batting, Pitching and Fielding)
        Then they have to choose the year of the stats they want to see from a drop down list.
        Once they choose above two player statistics will be displayed corresponding to the category in that particular year.
        
    Option - 3: Compare 2 Player's statistics
        In this option user get to enter another player's first and last name choose the category of the player stats they want to see             (Batting, Pitching and Fielding)
        Then they have to choose the year of the stats they want to see from a drop down list for both the players.
        Once they choose these, the player statistics for both the players will be displayed corresponding to the category in that                 particular year.
        
Phase - II of the App:
   In this phase, I will be adding more features to the app such as:
    Throwing the error messages in popups (Haven't done the exception handling yet)
    Giving option for user to chose between the Leagues (American League and National League)
    Searching the players based on the teams.
    Basic Graphical representation of the statistics instead if showing them in the numbers.(Main purpose of doing this app)
    
  My Deadline for the Phase - II is one week from now (Sep-28-2017). 
  
 Please note that I am not concentrating on the design of the APP, I want to improve my skills in python and Data Analysis libraries available in Python.
 
Please help me in the development of the App (and my programming skills) by pointing out the mistakes or letting me know if any method can be done simpler.
